<!--
A module is a file that contains code that you can make available in other places.
* Organizes our codebase
* Instead of having 1 large JS file, have many small ones broken out
* Prevents us from having to rewrite code
* Makes it more manageable.

Modules have strict mode enabled BY DEFAULT.
* Value of "this" is undefined in a module
* Variables we declare there are not gonna leak out, it will not pollute the mainspace




You can download the Live Server extension on VS Code. YOU CANNOT RUN THIS ON A FILE LOCATION
